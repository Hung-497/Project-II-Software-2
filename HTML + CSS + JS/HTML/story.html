        <p>Amazing news! A second layer to the microwave background radiation was discovered. Scientists came to the
            conclusion that it’s a new form of a black hole (red hole, or the hole of death - they call it). To be more
            precise, it is a wormhole, an unfortunate portal to The Database.
            Our world has taken a long time to program. So long, that not even our minds on the verge of complete
            insanity can comprehend. However minds are not completely useless, they hold small bits of information about
            reality, which makes it easier to handle the information on The Database. It stores all the data that is
            holding our realities together, holding, and creating, space for the old and new worlds.
            The Red Death is gigantic, but invisible. Its vendetta doesn’t make you shiver or panic, it lullabies you
            till you are peacefully, eternally, sleeping. It manifests itself in simpler and simpler language with which
            you hear your neighbours spreading rumours, in a more and more uncomplicated clothing and style, in a naive
            mind. The Red Death is little by little erasing everything that distinguishes us from a vacuum, swallowing
            the code of which our world consists. A requiem to humans written in real time.
            As the civilisation of the human race evolved, so did the science. Their search for meaning, or more
            precisely, illusion of its abundance for their minuscule, insignificant time. Petty try to make themselves
            useful. And to only drive themselves only more to the corner, they got to the technological revolution. The
            revolution consisted of creating a new civilisation resembling them. However, the revolution didn’t go as
            planned. One of the beta-technicians working on the infrastructure got into the system that handled The
            Database. Access to any Database handling unit was heavily controlled. One of the programs in the Database
            was civilians’ obedience, so the control was depended on that, no physical force was ever used whatsoever.
            Nevertheless, this one beta-technician was a bug in the code. The structure of The Database wasn’t as
            complicated to understand, but more so to handle. By mistake, or not, the technician managed to delete one
            of the core parts of the program. The people couldn’t feel it, but the program that they consisted of was
            slowly destroying itself. Like an undefined variable called in a function, the world’s marrow began to melt
            away. Starting from the stuff we don’t seem to notice, the change is so simple yet so stupefying that it is
            even funny to question. So, naturally, nobody does.
            After some time the Red Death sucked most of the computers out of existence. People went missing, most
            touching memories forgotten. Only a couple of The Database maintenance computers are left semi-destroyed in
            the world. On these computers, only a few programs remaining. And somewhere, far away from the scientists
            and their headlines, an engineer wakes up on a bench.
            Cogito, ergo sum. Thank Database I am finally awake. I cannot say how long I’ve been sleeping, but it sure
            was a good sleep for an engineer like me. As the feeling comes back to my limbs, I can feel something quite
            sharp under me. Sitting up, which proves to be difficult, I start to see blurry surroundings. Red, white,
            black - a banner, a wall, my shoes. Oh goodie, how did they end up so far away? As I’m trying to remember
            what happened, my head starts throbbing. There are cases when you enjoy your pain. Well, that wasn’t one of
            these cases. I could feel metallic spikes growing from my bones, piercing the shape of meat that I am.
            White, white, white. All is white and screaming, screaming from my ears, since I cannot move my mouth. I
            drop on my knees, oh what a dumb idea it was to stand anyway. After a while, when, at least, the screaming,
            my own internal screaming, has quieted, I tried again. Standing on my legs was bizarrely unfamiliar, and it
            took a while to get used to it. Walking to my shoes, I notice something dropping from my pocket. The first
            and last sentences are encrypted. The only thing in plain text reads something like “there are still
            computers left, scattered around the EU that can help you”. When putting on my shoes, it hits me. Jesus
            encryption. Of course. The letter uses one of the best encryption techniques of our time. There is a lot to
            unpack here and only few answers. Walking around, I felt proud of myself for figuring out that the place is
            an airport, since I remember airports looking differently. They usually were not these huge white
            sterile-looking blocks. But I can feel the atmosphere of rushing to finally see the loved ones, to get to an
            important meeting on time, of last-minute coffee before the flight. Life is so meaningful when you just look
            it in the eyes.
            I walk to a flock of people who gathered near a stand. Something red catches my attention - a magazine. It
            depicts a red hole - is this a joke? I, as little as I know about cosmology, know that the holes that are in
            spaces are black or white. As I’m trying to concentrate on the far-away magazine, someone spills his coffee
            and curses. When I look back I realise that the magazine’s cover reads “The Favourite Roses of the Season”.
            My mind must not be fully woken up hallucinating this much. Arriving to the gathering, I see a gelato stand.
            Ah, so we’re in Italy! Bongiorno, my teasing treat. Paying for the gelato, I can sense something off. The
            seller is looking at me too intently.
            Lorenzo, that was his name, made me wait a bit longer than the others. When finally he did return, he gave
            me a napkin with barely intelligible writing scribbled on it. “5”, under which “Gelato can taste sweet.”.
            What is this, a joke? 5 gelatos can taste sweet huh? I go to grab a coffee from a coffee shop to balance the
            sweetness of my vanilla ice cream. It takes me a little bit of time to realise that most like the number is
            related to the letter that I found in my pants. Who does this person think they are? Either something really
            weird is happening, or someone has to put their creativity into a better use. While the hot cup is burning
            my hand, I realise that the napkin might be a hint. Some high tech engineers do that sometimes, they make
            others’ life more difficult by not saying the thing straight and think they’re so cool. Anyway, I concluded
            the sentence to be an ICAO code. GCTS. Pack your shorts and sunglasses. But of course, since there is
            nothing for me to pack, I just buy the ticket with the money I will find in my pocket. Wow, I must have been
            really rich.
            After traveling for around two weeks, solving riddles and whatnot, I finally have most of the letter
            completed. Looking back, I can’t imagine how I did not just collapse from all the thinking and walking I
            have done. There were some computers, which of I somehow know something - I may have been a programmer in a
            different lifetime, that decoded parts of the messages. They were so bare, I didn’t see other stuff in them
            but just the deciphering programs. After a time I figured out that the hints were pretty straightforward - I
            always tried to explore most of the airports, since I had the time. The second airport I went to a bookstore
            owner gave me a book, with the title “Les Fleurs du Petit Garçon”. In the same place I found a small
            computer with a raspberry on it. Then I went to about ten airports with no luck. After nearly giving up, I
            went to a coffee shop in the French Charlie and found a chipmunk with “Eheh :)”. Great, now they’re just
            laughing at my stupidity.
            Looking back I just don’t get it how I didn’t see it. The ICAO code was right in front of my eyes without
            any hints and puzzles and I chose to ignore it. Well, in Eindhoven I saw such a beautifully simple sunset.
            With a warm tea and a spicy cinnamon bun in my in hand it was one of those moments which you look back to
            with a warm tear on your face, especially when you understand that it was one of the last agreeable moments
            you had. In the lounge I saw an arrow to the left, where I found yet another computer. No wonder nobody
            used, and just ignored them - they were blank without any fun programs in them. I managed to decrypt yet
            another part of the message, but then the computer displayed “ERROR 504: Data packet lost Driver mismatch
            detected Database access denied File structure corrupted” - glitch in the system, but maybe another hint?
            In Frankfurt I got the last part of the message. The computer was hidden in plain sight. Just there,
            standing in the middle of the airport. It sounded like the German people were speaking about something
            important, but it is difficult to understand when all you know is “hände hoch”. I decoded the last part of
            the letter and felt nothing. All the traveling, all the crash outs and beautiful moments for nothing.
            “(1)You have a great change to save the world, (2) do what you can, (the first/ original text) there are
            still computers left, scattered around the EU that can help you (3) to remember who you are (4) but don’t
            get too excited, (5) since I tricked you; the secret base, the key, my password - remember?”. And I did, as
            a tsunami focused on its vendetta the memories crashed into me like a personal attack. Like a personal
            attack for all the sorry mistakes I’ve made in my trivial life. In ym trivial life, affecting everyone,
            forever.
            I was pushed back into the regretful day I wanted to know. I wanted to know something that wasn’t meant for
            me for a reason. The legend about The Database, The Technicians. Terry, who wrote me the letter. He only
            wanted to laugh at me? He went extinct at some time, don’t exactly remember when. But even after that, my
            mistake was not enough, he wanted me to remember it forever. Oh Terry, I thought I fooled you by taking your
            logging in as you. By looking through the code in your name. By pretending to be you. But you were someone
            else all along.
            It was me who made the error. Because of me the people and the my most beloved world is slowly dying. After
            so much time being in nervous stupor, after so many hours of thinking so much that it wouldn’t have been
            weird if I went insane, I started to feel a sensation of peace. The peace came from forgetting what is
            difficult to digest. The code is still erasing itself, but this time, it was me who is destroying the
            synapse connections which make up the last couple of weeks’ events. Destroying myself, there is only one
            thought that pops into my mind - “winning is understanding that there are some battles that can’t be won no
            matter how hard you try”. Other than that it is just peace. I feel myself drifting away and choose to lie
            down. It has been a long battle for nothing, and I deserve to lie down on this bench. Cogito, ergo sum. But
            maybe that is the problem.
