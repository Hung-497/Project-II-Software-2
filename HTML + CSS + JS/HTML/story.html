                Will it ever be the same again?
                <br>
                It might have been the 16th. Or the 18th. You aren’t sure anymore.Days don’t separate themselves the way they used to , maybe they never did.
                <br>
                You woke to a letter you don’t remember receiving.No sender. Just fragments. Scratched-out lines. A warning.
                The airport looked normal enough at first. People walking. Coffee machines buzzing.But something felt missing.
                The sky was white. Not cloudy, not bright.White like an unfinished page.
                <br>
                Conversations sounded simpler than they should.Clothes looked wrong, like someone forgot half the details.
                Simpler. Easier.Wrong.
                <br>
                You decide you need answers.And whatever the world has become - whatever is still disappearing - the map is where you start.
